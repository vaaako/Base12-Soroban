# Base12 Soroban

# About
## Short
A digital version of a Base12 Soroban, for a friend in need of this tool<br>
I created this version because I couldn't find an existing one

## Complete
Today, I learned how to use a soroban. My friend is creating a conlang that
 will use a Base12 numbering system, so I told him about the soroban
 because it could help him. However, I couldn't find any online sorobans in Base12 (who would've thought),
 so I created this one for him

### What is a Soroban?
The Soroban is a traditional Japanese abacus used<br>
 for arithmetic calculations
